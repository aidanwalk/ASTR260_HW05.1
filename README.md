# ASTR260_HW05.1
Problem 1:
Execute ellipse_area.py by running python ellipse_area.py. This will calculate the area of an ellipse in 1 and 2 dimensional intergrals. Part 1 uses np.trapz for computation and part 2 uses numpy fast routines. The program will print out the answers obtained for 1. and 2. 

Problem 2:
I AM SORRY I PUT BOTH FLAT EARTH AND GLOBE EARTH IN THE SAME .PY FILE 
Execute grav_globe_sample.py by running python grav_globe_sample.py. This will print out the gravity vectors at the north and south poles and equator for a globular Earth and a flat Earth. 
I think the answers for the flat Earth are incorrect. I was not able to successfully diagnose this problem. 

I did not attempt part 3 of this problem :(
